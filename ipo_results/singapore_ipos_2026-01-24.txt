BOT CHECK: SGX connection status is SUCCESSFUL.

SECTION A (Last 7 Days: from 2026‑01‑17 to 2026‑01‑24)

I conducted searches on the SGX site and via general announcements but found no newly filed or newly announced IPOs or ETFs on SGX within the past seven days (i.e. since 17 January 2026). The most recent relevant announcements retrieved are from late 2025 or earlier:

- A general announcement dated 19 November 2025 regarding the Global Listing Board partnership with Nasdaq ([links.sgx.com](https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/ROFXXRMO0BHUTIZ2/?utm_source=openai)).

No IPO or ETF filings or listing announcements from 17 to 24 January 2026 were found.

SECTION B (Active Only – from SGX IPO Prospectus page, filtered for Closing Date ≥ 2026‑01‑24)

I accessed the "IPO Prospectus" page on SGX (part of investorrelations.sgx.com), but the page displayed is a generic template example dating from the year 2000 (e.g. closing date 21 November 2000) ([investorrelations.sgx.com](https://investorrelations.sgx.com/sgx-ipo-prospectus-2000?utm_source=openai)). It appears the publicly accessible SGX "IPO Prospectus" repository does not clearly list live or upcoming IPOs with closing dates, at least not via the base page.

Without a direct list of current IPO Prospectus entries (with their closing dates) available in the search results, I cannot reliably identify or filter active entries whose Closing Dates are on or after 24 January 2026.

To fulfill your requirement, you may need to consult the actual SGX IPO Prospectus portal or listing timetable, which may provide a table of live IPOs with their closing dates (e.g. for applications or subscription periods). That detailed page or PDF is not retrievable via the general index search.

If you can provide access to or specify the current IPO Prospectus listing page or PDF, including the relevant entries and their closing dates, I would be able to apply the date filter (include only Closing Date ≥ 2026‑01‑24 or status “TBA”), excluding any closed ones like MetaOptics (Sep 2025) or UltraGreen (Dec 2025).

In summary:

1. SECTION A: No new filings or announcements in the last seven days (17–24 Jan 2026).
2. SECTION B: Unable to list active IPOs due to lack of accessible data with closing dates. Please provide or point me to the current IPO Prospectus listing with closing dates.

Let me know if you can supply the listing document or URL so I can apply the strict date filter as requested.
