SECTION A – Last 7 Days (2025-12-31 to 2026-01-07):

After reviewing publicly available sources and SGX announcements, there appear to be **no newly filed or announced IPOs or ETFs** on SGX within the past 7 days (December 31, 2025 to January 7, 2026). Most recently reported IPO activity includes UltraGreen.ai (December 3, 2025) and wider positive sentiment, but **nothing falls within the last week**. ([ts2.tech](https://ts2.tech/en/singapore-exchange-ltd-sgx-s68-stock-on-10-december-2025-price-outlook-and-key-drivers/?utm_source=openai))

Therefore:

- No new IPO or ETF filings/announcements detected on SGX from **December 31, 2025 to January 7, 2026**.

SECTION B – Active Only (SGX IPO Prospectus Page, filtered by Closing Date ≥ 2026‑01‑07 or TBA):

I was unable to locate a publicly accessible SGX "IPO Prospectus" section listing current IPO/ETF offerings with accompanying Closing Dates via the SGX site. The only prospectus page found relates to SGX’s own listing back in 2000—clearly not relevant and dated ([investorrelations.sgx.com](https://investorrelations.sgx.com/sgx-ipo-prospectus-2000?utm_source=openai)).

Without a current SGX-hosted page listing active IPOs with Closing Dates or TBA statuses publicly visible, I cannot compile such a list. It's possible that SGX provides this information via a more dynamic interface or member login, which is not accessible for citation here.

Conclusion for Section B:

- **No entries could be retrieved** from the SGX IPO Prospectus page with Closing Dates today (2026‑01‑07), in the future, or marked TBA.
- Therefore, **no active entries** meet the filter criteria based on publicly available content.

Summary:

- Section A: No IPOs or ETFs announced/registered within the last 7 days.
- Section B: Unable to locate any active IPOs/ETFs with closing dates ≥ January 7, 2026, or marked TBA, via publicly available SGX prospectus listings.

Please let me know if you'd like me to assist further via an alternate source, or if you have access to the SGX portal where these listings may appear.
