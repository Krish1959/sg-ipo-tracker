Singapore IPO Watch – 2025-12-23

No credible new Singapore IPO announcements found in the last 7 days. Recent SGX-listed IPO activity (e.g., UltraGreen.ai — listing Dec 3; Leong Guan — listing Dec 11) occurred earlier in December; I found no authoritative SGX / MAS / company press-release or reputable financial-news announcement of a newly announced or newly lodged Singapore-related IPO between 2025-12-16 and 2025-12-23. ([links.sgx.com](https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/ipo-prospectus/3433?utm_source=openai))

If you’d like, I can:
- keep monitoring SGX / MAS / Business Times / Straits Times and alert you to any new Singapore IPO announcements, or
- run a targeted search for IPO filings (preliminary prospectus / offer documents) for specific companies or sectors.

Singapore IPO Watch – 2025-12-23

1) Company / issuer name:
   Dex-lab Pte Ltd (60%-owned subsidiary of Nova MSC Berhad)

   Expected listing date:
   TBA

   Exchange/board:
   Proposed listing on Singapore Exchange (SGX) — Catalist board (proposed).

   Brief description (1–2 lines):
   Dex-lab is a Singapore-based humanoid robotics and eldercare-technology business (60% owned by Malaysia’s Nova MSC). Nova MSC has announced plans/proposals for Dex-lab to seek a Catalist listing on SGX to scale its robotics and eldercare technology across Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and other APAC markets.

Note: I searched SGX announcements, MAS/Bursa/issuer filings and major Singapore business press for the period 16–23 Dec 2025. Apart from the Dex-lab (Nova MSC) proposal reported above, I did not find any other credible newly announced IPO filings or prospectus lodgements tied to SGX or Singapore-based issuers in that 7‑day window. ([theedgemalaysia.com](https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/784338?utm_source=openai))

If you’d like, I can (a) scan SGX/MAS filings hourly for any new prospectus lodgements over the next few days, or (b) expand the search to regional secondary listings and SPAC/REIT filings.

- monitor and send another update if any new Singapore IPO announcements appear over the next X days. Which would you prefer?
